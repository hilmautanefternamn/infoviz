first script reads dead.csv and outputs dead2.csv
second script reads dead2.csv and so on

last script is normalizeData.py in case u wanna get the values in percent.
The percent is "how many percent of the age group died from this cause"

when achieving finaldead.csv, remove the columns Mått and Kön
then change the name of the fields to english
Värde = Value
Ålder = Age
Diagnos = Diagnosis
Region = Region
År = Year
